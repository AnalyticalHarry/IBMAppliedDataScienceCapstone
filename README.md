# AppliedDataScienceCapstone

🚀 This Capstone represents the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, integrating all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program.

📄 Project Background
SpaceX, a leading company in the commercial space industry, offers cost-effective Falcon 9 rocket launches compared to other providers. The ability to reuse the first stage contributes significantly to cost savings. This project aims to predict the reuse of the first stage by analyzing variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits.

📄 Questions to be answered

How do payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings show an upward trend over the years?
Which algorithm is best suited for binary classification in this scenario?
📄 Methodology

Data collection methodology:
Utilized SpaceX REST API
Performed web scraping from Wikipedia
Conducted data wrangling:
Filtered the data
Handled missing values
Utilized One Hot Encoding for binary classification preparation
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
Utilized Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive visual analytics
Employed classification models for predictive analysis:
Built, tuned, and evaluated the models to achieve optimal results.
